# MPU-6000 is SPI or I2C.  MPU-6050 is I2C-only.  Driver does not
# support SPI so stick with I2C variant.

      The INT signal default configuration is active-high.  The
      property value should ensure the flags properly describe the
      signal that is presented to the driver.

      Sensor Data Sample Rate Divider.
      Sensor data Sample Rate = 8000Hz / (1 + Sample Rate Divider).
      While using I2C minimal Data Sample Rate Divider is 4, which results in
      1600Hz Sensor Data Sample Rate. Sample Rates higher than this are not
      recommended while using I2C.
      Valid range: 4 - 255
