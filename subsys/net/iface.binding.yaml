  Network interface configuraton.

  All nodes using this binding SHOULD be called "iface" or "iface@<u32>". At
  build time, devicetree nodes representing a network device MAY have exactly as
  many "iface[@<u32>]" child nodes with "status = 'okay'" as the corresponding
  device node instantiates network interfaces. In most cases this will be a
  single network interface per device node in which case the address part of the
  "iface" node is optional.

  If a single devicetree node instantiates more than one network interface, then
  the "iface" nodes SHOULD be named "iface@0", "iface@1", etc.

  Note: The interface node's address part has no semantic meaning other than
  uniquely identifying instances of interface nodes. Notably the address part
  does not correspond to the interface index.

      By default, interfaces will be brought up automatically during system
