config NONDETERMINISTIC_TIMING
	bool
	help
	  This hidden option is selected if the system time varies due to
	  circumstances beyond the OS itself. The most common case is QEMU systems
	  that do not implement 'icount' and are subject to timing variance due
	  to the host. This could also be enabled if Zephyr is a guest OS in
	  a virtualized environment, where hypervisor or other guest OS activity
	  could affect Zephyr's timing.

	  If selected, certain test scenarios which require certain
	  events to happen within a designated time period may be skipped.

config BOARD_DEPRECATED_RELEASE
	string
	help
	  This hidden option is set in the board configuration and indicates
	  the Zephyr release that the board configuration will be removed.
	  When set, any build for that board will generate a clearly visible
	  deprecation warning.

config QEMU_TARGET
	select NONDETERMINISTIC_TIMING if !QEMU_ICOUNT
	bool
	help
	  Mark all QEMU targets with this variable for checking whether we are
	  running in an emulated environment.

	  Enable QEMU virtual instruction counter. The virtual cpu will
	  execute one instruction every 2^N ns of virtual time. This will
	  give deterministic execution times from the guest point of view.
