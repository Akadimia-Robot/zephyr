Hexiwear Demonstration Applications
===================================

These are a set of small applications to demonstrate specific elements of
the Hexiwear device.   Some of the applications are self-contained to the
Hexiwear modules and others utilize the docking station and Click modules
from MikroE.

  feedback motor built into the Hexiwear

As additional features are available on this device, a corresponding
