  This allows you to define an emulated RGB LED by combining 3 individual LEDs.
  The individual LEDs must have their own driver and be defined in the dts.

  Here is an example
  / {
    rgb_leds {
      compatible = "rgb-leds";
      led_0 {
        red-led = <&red_led>;
        green-led = <&green_led>;
        blue-led = <&blue_led>;
      };
    };
  };

compatible: "rgb-leds"
