      Adjust the sensor sensitivity. The sensitivity can be calculated as
      57.5 / oversampling-factor (in lux per LSB) for normal and low resolution
      modes and 28.75 / oversampling-factor for high resolution. The default
      value on reset is 69, which gives 0.83 lx per LSB on normal and low
      resolution modes and 0.42 lx per LSB on high resolution. Higher values
      improve sensitivity but increase the sampling interval, calculated as
      2.61 ms * oversampling-factor for high and normal resolution modes, and
      as 0.35 ms * oversampling-factor for low resolution. The minimal and
      maximal values are 31 and 254.
    default: 69
