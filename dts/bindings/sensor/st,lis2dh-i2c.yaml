    STMicroelectronics LIS2DH 3-axis accelerometer accessed through I2C bus.

    This binding is supported by CONFIG_LIS2DH.

    The LIS3DH sensor is supported by the same driver, and should be
    specified in devicetree with:

        compatible = "st,lis3dh", "st,lis2dh";

    The LIS2DH12 sensor is supported by the same driver, and should be
    specified in devicetree with:

        compatible = "st,lis2dh12", "st,lis2dh";

    The accelerometer side of the LSM303DHLC sensor is supported by the
    same driver, and should be specified in devicetree with:

        compatible = "st,lsm303dlhc-accel", "st,lis2dh";

    The accelerometer side of the LSM303AGC sensor is supported by the
    same driver, and should be specified in devicetree with:

        compatible = "st,lsm303agr-accel", "st,lis2dh";


compatible: "st,lis2dh"

include: ["i2c-device.yaml", "st,lis2dh-common.yaml"]
