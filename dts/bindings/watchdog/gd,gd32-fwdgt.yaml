        Set timeout value in milliseconds.
        The following equation gives the maximum timeout value

          timeout = prescaler * reload / peripheral_freqency.

        where the maximum prescaler = 256 and the maximum reload = 4096.
        The peripheral_frequency uses GD32_LOW_SPEED_IRC_FREQUENCY
        that defined in modules/hal_gigadevice/Kconfig.
        Validate the value is within a capable range at the compile time.
