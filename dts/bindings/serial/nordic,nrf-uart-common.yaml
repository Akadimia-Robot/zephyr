        The TX pin to use. The value is "<&gpioX Y flags>".
        Pin PX.Y will be used for TX. The "flags" portion currently
        has no effect, but must be set to zero.

        For example, to use P0.16 for TX, set:

          tx-gpios = <&gpio0 16 0>;

        To use P1.2 for TX, set:

          tx-gpios = <&gpio1 2 0>;

        The RX pin to use. The value should be set in the same
        way as the tx-gpios property.

        The RTS pin to use. The value should be set in the same

        Deprecated; use tx-gpios instead.

        The TX pin to use.

        For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
        to use P0.16 for TX, set:

            tx-pin = <16>;

        For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
        example, to use P1.2 for TX, set:

            tx-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */

    rx-pin:
      type: int
      deprecated: true
      description: |
        Deprecated; use rx-gpios instead.

        The RX pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as the
        tx-pin property's.

    rts-pin:
      type: int
      deprecated: true
      description: |
        Deprecated; use rts-gpios instead.

        The RTS pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as the
        tx-pin property's.

    cts-pin:
      type: int
      deprecated: true

        The CTS pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as the
        tx-pin property's.
