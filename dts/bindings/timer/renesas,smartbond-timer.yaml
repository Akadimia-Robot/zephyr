      Clock prescaler at the input of the timer

      Sets timer counter mode.

      Use constants defined in dt-bindings/timer/smartbond-timer.h.

      * SMARTBOND_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP             - used as upcounter.
      * SMARTBOND_TIM_COUNTERMODE_DOWN           - used as downcounter.
      * SMARTBOND_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_DOWN    - counts up and down alternatively.
                                                   Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                                   are set only when the counter is counting down.
      * SMARTBOND_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_UP      - counts up and down alternatively.
                                                   Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                                   are set only when the counter is counting up.
      * SMARTBOND_TIM_COUNTERMODE_CENTER_UP_DOWN - counts up and down alternatively.
                                                   Output compare interrupt flags of output channels
                                                   are set only when the counter is counting
                                                   up or down.

      If absent, then SMARTBOND_TIM_COUNTERMODE_UP is used (reset state).
