description: Bosch m_can CAN-FD controller

compatible: "st,stm32-fdcan"

include: bosch-mcan.yaml

properties:
    pinctrl-0:
      type: phandles
      required: false
      description: |
        GPIO pin configuration for CAN signals (RX, TX). We expect
        that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.

        For example the can1 would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&fdcan1_rx_pa11 &fdcan1_tx_pa12>;

    shared-irq-names:
      type: string-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Name of each shared-irq in shared-irqs.
        Required if shared-irqs are used and interrupts are chosen by name.

    shared-irqs:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        To avoid interrupt conflicts shared-irq nodes can be referenced.
        In case the referenced shared_irq phandles have status okay the driver
        registers the isr with the shared_irq instance instead of connecting to
        the irq.

        Example for stm32g0 would be
              shared-irqs = <&shared_irq21 &shared_irq22>;
