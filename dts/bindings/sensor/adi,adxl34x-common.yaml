  int-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Interrupt GPIO to support FIFO mode and other interrupts.

  int-pin:
    type: int
    default: 1
    enum:
      - 1 # interrupt is generated from INT1
      - 2 # interrupt is generated from INT2
    description: |
      Select the interrupt pin in use when data is available, or an event
      occurred (1 or 2). The ADXL34x has two interrupt pins of which only one is
      needed for this driver. The other interrupt can be used to control other
      hardware directly. Defaults to 1 (INT1), the power-on reset value.

  packet-size:
    type: int
    default: 16
    description: |
      The number of accelerometer samples in one packet when streaming data. The
      size ranges from 1 to 31 samples and defaults to halve the FIFO size.

  accel-frequency:
    type: string
    default: "100"
    description: |
      Default frequency of accelerometer. Power-on reset value is 100 Hz.
    enum:
      - "0.10"
      - "0.20"
      - "0.39"
      - "0.78"
      - "1.56"
      - "3.13"
      - "6.25"
      - "12.5"
      - "25"
      - "50"
      - "100"
      - "200"
      - "400"
      - "800"
      - "1600"
      - "3200"

  accel-range:
    type: int
    default: 16
    description: |
      Default range of accelerometer. Power-on reset value is +-16 g.
    enum:
      - 2
      - 4
      - 8
      - 16
