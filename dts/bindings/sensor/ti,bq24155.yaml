compatible: "ti,bq24155"

include: i2c-device.yaml

properties:
    input-current:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: maximum current charger can pull
                   from power supply in mA.

    weak-voltage:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: weak battery voltage threshold in mV.
                   The chip will use slow precharge if
                   battery voltage is below this value.

    regulation-voltage:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: maximum charging voltage in mV.

    charge-current:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: maximum charging current in mA.

    termination-current:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: charge will be terminated when current in
                   constant-voltage phase drops below this value (in mA).

    resistor-sense:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: value of sensing resistor in milliohm.
