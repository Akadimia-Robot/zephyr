title: SAM0 Digital Frequency Locked Loop (DFLL)
version: 0.1

description: >
    This is a representation of a SAM0 fixed frequency Digital Frequency
    Locked loop.  This is a fixed frequency clock that can optionally use
    a reference input to adjust its calibration dynamically.

inherits:
    !include clock.yaml

properties:
    compatible:
      constraint: "atmel,sam0-dfll"

    clock-output-names:
      category: required

    clock-frequency:
      type: int
      description: >
        Output frequency of the DFLL.  This is fixed but determined by the
        SoC hardware.
