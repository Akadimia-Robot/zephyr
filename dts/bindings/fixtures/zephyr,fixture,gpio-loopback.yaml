    This binding provides resources required to support tests that
    require the gpio-loopback feature.

    Presence of a node with this compatible, even with status "okay",
    does not imply that the shorted connections required to run tests
    with this feature are present.

compatible: "zephyr,fixture,gpio-loopback"

properties:
    out-gpios:
        type: phandle-array
        required: true
        description: |
          Identity of a GPIO that will be configured as an output.  This
          must be on the same device as in-gpios, and physically
          connected to in-gpios.

          Where a board has an Arduino-compatible header this is
          preferred to be one of the following:

            out-gpios = <&arduino_header 6 0>; /* Arduino D0 */
            out-gpios = <&arduino_header 0 0>; /* Arduino A0 */
