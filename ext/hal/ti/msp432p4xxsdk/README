The MSP432 SDK provides a peripheral driver library and hardware
register access header files for the Texas Instruments SimpleLink
MSP432 SoC's.

The current version supported in Zephyr is MSP432 SDK V1.40.00.28, downloaded
from:

	http://www.ti.com/tool/simplelink-msp432-sdk

Files in driverlib/ and inc/ are copied from an SDK installation
(without modification).

After setting CONFIG_HAS_MSP432SDK=y in Kconfig, there are two methods
for using the peripheral driver library:

1) (Default) Use the driverlib functions in ROM instead of RAM.

TI provides the driver library functions burned into ROM at the factory,
or updated via a service pack patch, thus saving application code space.

Setting CONFIG_MSP432SDK_ROM_DRIVERLIB enables all driverlib APIs prefixed by
"MAP_" to vector to those functions already existing in ROM.

2) Use the driver library functions built from the MSP432SDK files in Zephyr.

Setting CONFIG_MSP432SDK_BUILTIN allows building those files within
the Zephyr ext/hal/ti/ subdirectory. Though this will take more code space
than using the ROM driverlib functions, this may be useful for debugging
purposes.

Applications can use the two configurations simultaneously:  For example, calling
APIs without the "MAP_" prefix would call into Zephyr-built driver lib functions in
RAM, while calling APIs with the "MAP_" prefix would call into the ROM.
