    description: |
      Adjust the oversampling factor of the sensor to compensate for window
      absorption. For example, if the sensor is behind an optical window with
      50% absorption, the default factor should be multiplied by 2 (138).
      Acceptable values are from 31 to 254, corresponding to (0.45 and 3.68
      times the default value, respectively).  The sampling time is this factor
      multiplied by 2.61 ms (normal and high resolution) or 0.35 ms (low res).
    default: 69
