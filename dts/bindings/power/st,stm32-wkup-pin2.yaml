  STM32 system wakeup Node for stm32H5, stm32H7 and stm32MP1
  when polarity and pull-up/down are configurable for each pin.

compatible: "st,stm32-wkup-pin2"

properties:
  syswakeup-pin:
    type: int
    description: |
      nb (index) of the sys wakeup pin associated with the GPIO
      For example PC13 is associated with wakeup pin nb <2> on the stm32h575

  "#wkpin-cells":
    type: int
    const: 2
    description: |
      reference to the system wakeup pin and its polarity
      plus its pull-up/down config to trig the wakeup event.

# Parameter syntax of stm32 follows the st,stm32-pwr dts syntax

wkpin-cells:
  - polarity
  - pupd
