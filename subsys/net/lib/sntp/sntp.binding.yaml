  The SNTP library is part of the network subsystem and can be configured using
  this binding.

  The SNTP configuration nodes SHALL be named according to the pattern
  "sntp@<int>". The address part of the node is used to identify the SNTP node
  instance and does not have any further semantic meaning. If there is a single
  SNTP node in an application configuration, the address part can be left out.
