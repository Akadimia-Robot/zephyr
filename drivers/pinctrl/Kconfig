config PINCTRL_RUNTIME_DTS
	bool "Enable run time pin configuration control based on DTS"
	default y
	help
	  Supports extended pin controller functionality.

	  Enable if run time pin configuration control based on
	  device tree information is needed.

config PINCTRL_PINMUX
	bool "Enable generic PINMUX interface for pinctrl drivers"
	default y
	help
	  Map PINMUX functions to PINCTRL functions.

	  Enable to use the PINMUX interface with pinctrl drivers.
	  This interface is for transition. Only use if necessary
	  by drivers calling this interface.

config PINCTRL_INIT_PRIORITY
	int
	prompt "Init priority"
	default 2
	help
	  Pinctrl driver initialization priority.

	  Pinctrl driver almost certainly should be initialized before the
	  rest of hardware devices (which may need specific pins already
	  configured for them).
	  Thus, its priority should be between KERNEL_INIT_PRIORITY_DEFAULT
	  and KERNEL_INIT_PRIORITY_DEVICE. There are exceptions to this
	  rule for particular boards. Don't change this value unless you
	  know what you are doing.

config SYS_LOG_PINCTRL_LEVEL
	int
	prompt "PINCTRL Driver Log level"
	depends on SYS_LOG
	default 0
	range 0 4
	help
	  Sets log level for PINCTRL drivers.

	  Levels are:

	    - 0 OFF, do not write

	    - 1 ERROR, only write SYS_LOG_ERR

	    - 2 WARNING, write SYS_LOG_WRN in addition to previous level

	    - 3 INFO, write SYS_LOG_INF in addition to previous levels

	    - 4 DEBUG, write SYS_LOG_DBG in addition to previous levels
