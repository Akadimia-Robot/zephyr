Status:
   version STM32Cube_FW_L4_V1.10.0STM32Cube_FW_L4_V1.10.0

Purpose:
   library to use the Inventek Ism43362-m3g-l44 wifi component

Description:
   This library written by STMicroelectronics is dedicated to Inventek Ism43362-m3g-l44 wifi component.

   This library can be called from the wifi driver or directly from a sample application.
   The adaptation to Zephyr platform (spi and gpio) is made in es_wifi_io.c file.

   In order to use this library, you have to :
      * define CONFIG_WIFI_ISM43362_M3G_L44, CONFIG_WIFI_SPI_DEV_NAME and CONFIG_WIFI_SPI_CLK_FREQ
      * include wifi.h

Dependencies:
   This package depends on Zephyr SPI and GPIO implementations and is linked statically.
   This library will be used by a standard Zephyr driver or by applications.
