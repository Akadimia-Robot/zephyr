description: BH1750 ambient light sensor sensor

compatible: "rohm,bh1750"

include: [sensor-device.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:
  resolution:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Sensor resolution.
      The values are the corresponding hexadecimal values to
      write to configuration register.
      Default H-resolution mode (1lx) since it is the recommended
      mode in the page 5 of datasheet.
    enum:
      - 0 # 0.5 lx - Measurement Time is typically 120ms
      - 1 # 1 lx - Measurement Time is typically 120ms
      - 3 # 4 lx - Measurement Time is typically 16ms

  mode:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Specifies the measurement mode used by the driver.
      The options are continuously mode (one new measurement
      is ready continuously) or one-time-mode (perform only one
      measurement and then set sensor power down mode).
      Default CONTINUOUSLY-MODE for continuous sensing, more
      common value.
    enum:
      - 0 # CONTINUOUSLY-MODE
      - 1 # ONE-TIME-MODE

  mtreg:
    type: int
    default: 69
    description: |
      Duration of single measurement process.
      The greater the value, the longer the duration
      and greater accuracy. After sensor power-on
      mtreg register is set to default value of
      this property (chosen by sensor manufacturer): 69.
      Valid values are in range 31-254 (inclusive).
