# Common fields for zephyr devices

properties:
    zephyr,no-lock:
        type: boolean
        required: false
        description: |
            Unset by default, it enables the possibility to avoid allocating a lock
            on the device instance.

    zephyr,no-sync:
        type: boolean
        required: false
        description: |
            Unset by default, it enables the possibility to avoid allocating
            a synchronization object on the device instance. This can be useful if
            the device driver works on polling mode only.
