## Definitions

### thread-safe

A function is thread-safe if its behavior is correct when invoked from
multiple threads at the same time.

### reentrant

A function is reentrant if its behavior is correct when it is invoked by
(indirect) recursion from the same thread.

### interrupt-safe

A function is interrupt-safe if its behavior is not affected by
concurrent access from interrupts.

### block

A call blocks if it can suspend the invoking thread while it waits for
something to happen.

### atomic

An operation is atomic if the steps it makes internally cannot be
affected by nor visible to interleaving executions, such as from
interrupts or thread pre-emption.
