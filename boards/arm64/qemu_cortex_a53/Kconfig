# The GICv3 & ITS drivers allocation needs are:
# - LPI prop table: global 1x64K aligned on 64K
# - LPI pend table: for each redistributor/cpu 1x64K aligned on 64K
# - Devices table: 8x64K aligned on 64K
# - Interrupt Collections table: 1x64K aligned on 64K
#
# This makes 11x64K allocations aligned on 64K, but due to alignment constraints,
# HEAP needs to be 14x64K to permit all allocations to success.
#
# Note, will need 64K HEAP_MEM per CPUs added.
#
# This doesn't necessarily include the Interrupt Translation Table, which are
# 256bytes aligned tables, for reference a 32 ITEs table needs 512bytes.
# With 14x64K HEAP, up to 254 ITT tables of 32 ITEs can be allocated.
