Hexiwear Demonstration Applications
===================================

These are a set of small applications to demonstrate specific elements of
the Hexiwear device.   Some of the applications are self-contained to the
Hexiwear modules and others utilize the docking station and Click modules
from MikroE.

- `blinky <_hexiwear-blinky-sample>`_ uses the RGB LED built into the Hexiwear
- `dock-blink <_hexiwear-docking-station-sample>`_ uses the LEDs on the docking station
- `haptic <_hexiwear-haptic-sample>`_ uses the haptic feedback motor
- `rotary-leds <_hexiwear_rotary_led>`_ implements reading the rotary encoder and lighting LEDs
- `4x4-buttons <_hexiwear-4x4-buttons>`_ reads the 16 button Click interface

As additional features are available on this device, a corresponding
test/example will be added here
