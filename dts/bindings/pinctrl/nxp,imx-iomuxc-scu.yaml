        This is an array of values defining the pin mux selection with the following format:
        <pad, mux, sw_config, lp_config, drive_strength, pull_selection>

        pad: Which pad to configure.
        mux: The MUX value => selects which signal to route.
        sw_config: I/O configuration.
        lp_config: Low power configuration.
        drive_strength: Pad drive strength. (optional)
        pull_selection: Pull configuration. (optional)

        Please note that, as mentioned above, "drive_strength" and "pull_selection" fields
        are optional. If one wants to configure those fields, one needs to specify both of
        them. This is enforced by the pinctrl driver.
