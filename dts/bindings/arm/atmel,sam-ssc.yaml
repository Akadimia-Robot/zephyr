  dmas:
    description: |
      TX & RX dma specifiers.  Each specifier will have a phandle
      reference to the dma controller, the channel number, and peripheral
      trigger source.

      For example dmas for TX, RX would look like
         dmas = <&xdmac 22 DMA_PERID_SSC_TX>, <&xdmac 23 DMA_PERID_SSC_RX>;

  dma-names:
    description: |
      This should be "tx" and "rx" to match the dmas property.

      For example
         dma-names = "tx", "rx";

  rk-enabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If enabled RK signal is connected to RK pin. It will be configured as
      an output or an input depending on whether the receiver is working
      in master or slave mode.

      If disabled RK signal is disconnected from RK pin and connected
      internally to TK (Transmitter Clock signal).

  rf-enabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If enabled RF signal is connected to RF pin. It will be configured as
      an output or an input depending on whether the receiver is working
      in master or slave mode.

      If disabled RF signal is disconnected from RF pin and connected
      internally to TF (Transmitter Frame Synchro signal).
