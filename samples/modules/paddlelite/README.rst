Paddle Lite CNN sample
######################

Overview
********

This example demonstrates the Paddle Lite application's inference on a CNN model.
The Paddle Lite version is Paddle Lite2.6. The models are trained on Baiduâ€™s official website and cropped using the opt tool of Baidu Paddle Lite2.6.
Due to the lack of the opencv library, a tensor whose values are all one is used to simulate an image, and the output is the output shape and corresponding probability.


Building and Running
********************

This application can also be built and executed on roc_rk3568_pc as follows:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/modules/paddlelite
   :host-os: unix
   :board: roc_rk3568_pc
   :goals: run
   :compact:


After completing the above process, you need to execute the following command to run:

setenv serverip 192.168.0.102
setenv ipaddr 192.168.0.103
tftp 0x40000000 zephyr.bin;
tftp 0x70000000 resnet18.nb;
dcache flush; icache flush; dcache off; icache off; go 0x40000000;

The above means selecting resnet18. If you want to select mobilenet_v1, execute tftp 0x70000000 mobilenet_v1.nb.

The trained model can be downloaded directly from the Paddle Lite official website.Currently supported models include: SqueezeNet, ShuffleNetV2, MnasNet, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV1, InceptionV4, ResNet18, ResNet50.

The .nb file is a trimmed and quantized binary file of Paddle Lite's model file.After downloading the corresponding model file, you need to use the opt tool to trim and quantify the model.

Sample Output
=============

Take the output of mobilenet_v1 as an example. It is trained for imagenet, so the output shape is 1000, and 10 of the probabilities are selected as output.

.. code-block:: console

    Output shape 1000
    Output[0]: 0.000191311
    Output[100]: 0.000159713
