config JSON_LIBRARY
	bool "Build JSON library"
	help
	  Build a minimal JSON parsing/encoding library. Used by sample
	  applications such as the NATS client.

config RING_BUFFER
	bool "Enable ring buffers"
	help
	  Enable usage of ring buffers. This is similar to kernel FIFOs but ring
	  buffers manage their own buffer memory and can store arbitrary data.
	  For optimal performance, use buffer sizes that are a power of 2.

config MEMOBJ
	bool "Enable memory object"
	help
	  Enable usage of memory object. It allows to store variable length data
	  in fragmented chunks providing efficient memory utilization at the
	  cost of data access time (data is copied in and out from memory
	  object).

config BASE64
	bool "Enable base64 encoding and decoding"
	help
	  Enable base64 encoding and decoding functionality
