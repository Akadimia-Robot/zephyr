      Open Drain frequency (in Hz) for the I3C controller. The frequency
      is fixed and cannot be changed. This is together with Push-pull and
      I2c frequency which can be set via i3c_configure API to change the
      baudrate at run time.

      When undefined, the default value will be used as specified by the
      I3C specification.
