	  Select BH1750 resolution mode. The illuminance per LSB in normal and
	  low resolution modes is mode is 57.5 / oversampling-factor (in lux),
	  with typical limits of detection of 1 lx for normal and 4 lx for low
	  resolution.  In high resolution, the illuminance per LSB is 28.75 /

	  resolution modes and 0.35 ms * oversampling-factor in low resolution.
