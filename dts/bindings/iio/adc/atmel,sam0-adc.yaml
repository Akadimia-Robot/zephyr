      description: >
        The maximum clock rate the ADC can operate at (Hz).  This is used
        to calculate the divisor applied to the input clock required to
        achieve a frequency less than or equal to the requested one.
        Normally this can be set to the maximum hardware supported frequency.
        It can also be used to lower the frequency to achieve longer sample
        acquisition times.
