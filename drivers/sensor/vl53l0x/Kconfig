menuconfig VL53L0X
	bool "VL53L0X time of flight sensor"
	default y
	depends on DT_HAS_ST_VL53L0X_ENABLED
	depends on ZEPHYR_HAL_ST_MODULE
	select I2C
	select HAS_STLIB
	help
	  Enable driver for VL53L0X I2C-based time of flight sensor.

config VL53L0X_PROXIMITY_THRESHOLD
	int "Proximity threshold in millimeters"
	default 100
	depends on VL53L0X
	help
	  Threshold used for proximity detection when sensor is used with SENSOR_CHAN_PROX.

config VL53L0X_RECONFIGURE_ADDRESS
	bool "Support reconfigurable sensor address"
	depends on VL53L0X
	help
	  Enable support for reconfiguring the sensor address at runtime.
	  When this option is enabled, all sensors declared in the device tree
	  must have an xshut-gpio property.

	  All sensors are disabled during initialization. When reading the first
	  value from a sensor, it is powered up and its I2C address is reconfigured
	  from the manufacturer default (0x29) to the address specified in the
	  device tree.

config VL53L0X_SETUP_MAX_TIME_FOR_RANGING
	int "config max time for ranging"
	default 33000
	depends on VL53L0X
	help
	  Set max time for ranging in Î¼s
	
config VL53L0X_SETUP_SIGNAL_LIMIT_RATIO
	int "config signal limit ratio"
	default 100
	depends on VL53L0X
	help
	  Specify a floating point value multiplied by 1000.
	  For example, a value of 1 represents 0.001 in real value.
	  default value 100 is set VL53L0X_SETUP_SIGNAL_LIMIT (0.1 * 65536)

config VL53L0X_SETUP_SIGMA_LIMIT_RATIO
	int "config sigma limit ratio"
	default 60000
	depends on VL53L0X
	help
	  Specify a floating point value multiplied by 1000.
	  For example, a value of 1 represents 0.001 in real value.
	  default value 60000 is set VL53L0X_SETUP_SIGMA_LIMIT (60 * 65536)
