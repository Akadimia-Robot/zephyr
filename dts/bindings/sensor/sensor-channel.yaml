# Properties for sensor channels, where a sensor channel is considered a grouping
# of sensor fields, and a sensor field is a scalar measurement of a physical
# phenomenom. A channel then is a vector of fields. A sensor a vector of channels.
#
# A channel might also be a channel from a sensor hub like device and optionally
# enable with additional configuration options for a particular device.

description: Sensor Channel

include: base.yaml

properties:
  channel-index:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The numerical index in an array of channels the sensor provides. For
      example the 0th channel may be the accelerometer channel, the 1st may be
      a gyro, and 3rd may be a magnetometer. Some devices may group several
      channels together and in Zephyr those would be fields in a channel rather
      than individual channels. Each channel might typically come with its own ability
      to set sensitivity, odr, and so on.

  channel-type:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      The type of physical sensing information provided by this channel. It
      can be used to identify a channel of data from a sensor that provides
      for example acceleration, rotational velocity, magnetic field strength,
      light intensity, and more.

      The channel type identifiers are defined in C and are extensible.

  channel-fields:
    type: array
    description: |
      A sensor channel may itself be representative of a multi-dimensional
      array containing relative data about a particular physical measurement.
      This may be the filtered frequencies of light in a spectrometer, the
      euclidean alignment of mems sensors for x, y, z, or a simple array of
      values for things like ToF sensors with 1 or 2 dimensional arrays readings.

      Each field is given by a pair (Field Descriptor, Length) to signify the channel
      produces fields with a particular meaning and N of them.

      Example fields usages

      channel-fields: <SENSOR_FIELD_XYZ 1>
