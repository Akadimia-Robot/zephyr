    description: |
      Sampling frequency of accelerometer [Hz]. Only the listed values are allowed.
      The position in enum is already the value to write to register (with a proper offset).
      The default chip reset frequency is 200 Hz.

  full-scale-range-g:
    description: Full scale range in [g].
      The position in enum is already the value to write to register (with a proper offset).
      The default chip reset range is 8 g.

    description: |
      Accelerometer power mode.
      The position in enum is already the value to write to register (with a proper offset).
      The default chip reset mode is HPM.
      "LPM" - Low power mode (Duty Cycling mode)
      "HPM" - High performance mode (Continuous mode)
    type: string
    default: "HPM"
