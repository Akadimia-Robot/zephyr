compatible: "sensing,emul"

include: [sensor-device.yaml, base.yaml]

properties:

  sensor-types:
    type: array
    required: true
    description: |
      One or more sensor data types that are provided by this device. For
      example, a 'dev' pointing to a bmi160 may report accel/gyro/die_temp or
      any subset of those types.

  rotation-matrix:
    type: array
    description: |
      3x3 matrix to rotation x, y, and z axes.
      In order to make application logic agnostic to how the device was placed
      on the board, it's possible to enter the rotation matrix which will be
      applied to every sample produced by this sensor. The final orientation
      will be:
      * X-axis is horizontal and positive toward the right
      * Y-axis is vertical and positive toward the top
      * Z-axis is depth and positive toward the user
      
      If not provided, the rotation matrix will be the identity matrix.
      Otherwise, the following will be used:
      
      +-        -+   +-        -+   +- -+
      | v1 v2 v3 |   | sensor_X | = | X |
      | v4 v5 v6 | * | sensor_Y | = | Y |
      | v7 v8 v9 |   | sensor_Z | = | Z |
      +-        -+   +-        -+   +- -+
