      The signed value controls StallGuard2 level for stall output
      and sets the optimum measurement range for readout.
      A lower value gives a higher sensitivity.
      Zero is the starting value working with most motors.
      For instance, in case of tmc5041, range is -64 to +63
      A higher value makes StallGuard2 less sensitive
      and requires more torque to indicate a stall.
