	  Builds the (posix) app with profiling and instruction
	  instrumentation arguments such that it can be used with
	  external coverage tools.  Note that this is not the same
	  feature as the gprof-based coverage tools used elsewhere in
	  Zephyr!  Requires ARCH_POSIX currently, as there is no
	  infrastructure for retrieving the resulting .profraw data on
	  embedded builds.
