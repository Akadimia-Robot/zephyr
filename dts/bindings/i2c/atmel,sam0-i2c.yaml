description: Atmel SAM0 series SERCOM I2C node

compatible: "atmel,sam0-i2c"

include: i2c-controller.yaml

properties:
    reg:
      required: true

    interrupts:
      required: true

    clocks:
      required: true

    clock-names:

    pinctrl-0:
      type: phandles
      description: |
        PORT pin configuration for the I2C signals. We expect that
        the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These nodes will
        have a nodelabel that matches the Atmel SoC HAL defines and
        be of the form p<port><pin><periph>_<inst>_<signal>.

        For example the SERCOM0 on SAMR21 could be
           pinctrl-0 = <&pa4d_sercom0_pad0 &pa5d_sercom0_pad1>;

      required: true

    dmas:
      description: |
        Optional TX & RX dma specifiers.  Each specifier will have a phandle
        reference to the dmac controller, the channel number, and peripheral
        trigger source.

        For example dmas for TX, RX on SERCOM3
           dmas = <&dmac 0 0xb>, <&dmac 0 0xa>;

    dma-names:
      description: |
        Required if the dmas property exists.  This should be "tx" and "rx"
        to match the dmas property.

        For example
           dma-names = "tx", "rx";
