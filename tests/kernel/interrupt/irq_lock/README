This test case intended to validate the irq_lock api.
A thread may temporarily prevent all IRQ handling in the
system using the irq_lock.

The IRQ lock is thread-specific. If thread A locks out
interrupts then performs an operation that allows thread B
to run (e.g. giving a semaphore or sleeping for N milliseconds),
the threadâ€™s IRQ lock no longer applies once thread A is swapped out.
This means that interrupts can be processed while thread B is running
unless thread B has also locked out interrupts using its own IRQ lock.
