menuconfig FLASH_MAP

	depends on FLASH_HAS_DRIVER_ENABLED
	help
	  Enable support of flash map abstraction.

config FLASH_MAP_SHELL
	bool "Enable flash map shell interface"
	depends on SHELL
	help
	  This enables shell commands to list and test flash maps.

config FLASH_MAP_DEV_IN_FLASH_AREA
	bool "Switch flash map to use compile time evaluated devices objects"
	default y if !FLASH_MAP_CUSTOM
	help
	  The option adds the fa_dev field to the flash_area structure that allows to evaluate flash
	  device object pointer at compile time, and store it within flash_area structure to avoid
	  run-time calls to obtain it.
	  Enabling the option switches flash map API to use the flash_area.fa_dev instead of using
	  flash_area.fa_dev_name to get device by name.
	  In case of the default flash map, enabling this option will cause the fa_dev, of
	  each map entry, to be populated with a pointer to the device tied to that flash area.
	  The option is set to n, by default, for custom flash maps (FLASH_MAP_CUSTOM=n); if your
	  custom map populates the flash_area.fa_dev areas you may want to set this option to
	  improve flash map performance.

config FLASH_MAP_CUSTOM
	bool "Custom flash map description"
	help
	  This option enables custom flash map description.
	  User must provide such a description in place of default on
	  if had enabled this option.

config FLASH_AREA_CHECK_INTEGRITY
	bool "Enable flash check functions"
	select TINYCRYPT
	select TINYCRYPT_SHA256
	help
	  If enabled, there will be available the backend to check flash
	  integrity using SHA-256 verification algorithm.
