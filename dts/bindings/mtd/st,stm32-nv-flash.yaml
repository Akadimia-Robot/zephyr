compatible: st,stm32-nv-flash

properties:
  max-erase-time:
    type: int

      This property defines the Internal SoC Flash size in KB. This is needed
      since M4 CPU doesn't have access to flash controller register to read
      the size. Define this in DTS to use flash controller driver on M4.
