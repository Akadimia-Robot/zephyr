          description: Erase block size used for erasing the partition, should
                       be multiple of the flash erase block size at the location
                       of the partition. When a partition is used that spans
                       regions with different erase block sizes the value should
                       be a multiple of the largest block size. If unspecified
                       the partition size is used as erase block size.
