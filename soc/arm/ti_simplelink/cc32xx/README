Notes for CC32XXSF:
 * Text must start at 0x800 offset in flash.  The first 0x800 bytes are
   reserved for the flash header.
 * See CONFIG_ROM_START_OFFSET.

Notes for CC32XXS:
 * CC32XXS has no integrated flash Memory.
 * TI bootloader takes first 16 KiB of the 256 KiB SRAM, so app must start at
   0x20004000. The SRAM size must be set to 240 KiB or less. However, the first
   16 KiB could be used in a NOLOAD section.
