title: SAM0 Generic Clock (GCLK) provider
version: 0.1

description: >
    This is a representation of a SAM0 Generic Clock provider.  A GCLK is
    a clock distribution mechanism that connects an input clock with various
    consumers.  It can optionally provide a divisor on the input clock, so
    the output clock frequency may be different than the input frequency.

inherits:
    !include clock.yaml

      constraint: "atmel,sam0-gclk"

      description: >
        Output frequency of the the GCLK (Hz).  This is used to calculate
        the divisor applied to the input clock source that the GCLK is
        connected to.
