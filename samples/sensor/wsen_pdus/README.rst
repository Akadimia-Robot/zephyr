WSEN-PDUS: Differential Pressure Sensor
#######################################

Overview
********

This sample uses the Zephyr :ref:`sensor_api` API driver to periodically
read pressure and temperature from the WÃ¼rth Elektronik WSEN-PDUS differential
pressure sensor and displays it on the console.

Requirements
************

This sample requires a WSEN-PDUS sensor connected via the I2C interface.

Building and Running
********************

This sample supports WSEN-PDUS sensors connected via I2C. Configuration is
done via the :ref:`devicetree <dt-guide>`. The devicetree must have an
enabled node with ``compatible = "we,wsen-pdus";``. See
:dtcompatible:`we,wsen-pdus` for the devicetree binding.

The sample reads from the sensor and outputs sensor data to the console at
regular intervals.

Note that the ``sensor-type`` devicetree parameter has to be set to match
the PDUS sensor variant (pressure measurement range) being used.
