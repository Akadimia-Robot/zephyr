      An array of pre-computed baudrates needed for the controller to setting
      up I2C speed for I2C communication. For each used I2C rate, three elements
      need to be provided in the order: I2C, Open-Drain and Push-pull baudrate.
      These baudrates should be calculated by user based on Functional Clock and
      as required by application.

      For example: I3C instance 0 with Functional Clock is 134Mhz and application
      intends to use STANDARD, FAST and FAST_PLUS speed:

        &i3c0 = {
          baudrate-cfg = <I2C_BITRATE_STANDARD 500000 6000000>,
                          <I2C_BITRATE_FAST 1000000 6000000>,
                          <I2C_BITRATE_FAST_PLUS 1000000 6000000>;
        }

      The baudrate configuration does not need to be declared for unused I2C speeds.
