    pinctrl-0:
      type: phandles
      description: |
        PIO pin configuration for URXD & UTRD signals.  We expect that
        the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes.  These nodes will
        have a nodelabel that matches the Atmel SoC HAL defines and
        be of the form p<port><pin><periph>_<inst>_<signal>.

        For example the USART0 on SAME7x would be
           pinctrl-0 = <&pa9a_uart0_urxd0 &pa10a_uart0_utxd0>;
