  Generic IEEE 802.15.4 MAC configuration shared by all IEEE 802.15.4 L2
  implementations.

  Note: Please do not add PHY-specific properties to this binding file.
  Currently we do not support IEEE 802.15.4 PHY-specific configuration. Once
  drivers appear that require PHY-specific configuration, we will add
  corresponding subnode bindings for each supported channel page.

  All nodes using this binding SHALL be called "ieee802154" and SHALL be placed
  inside the corresponding "iface" node.

  Existing "ieee802154[g]" nodes placed directly below a radio peripheral will
  continue to be supported but are deprecated. IEEE 802.15.4 interface drivers
  will consider both locations and merge the result.

  Matching IEEE 802.15.4 interface drivers SHALL be derived from the compatible
  string at the radio device peripheral level further up in the tree hierarchy.
  Drivers matched at the "ieee802154[g]" node level will continue to be
  supported but are deprecated.

  If multiple interface drivers exists for a given radio periopheral then the
  proper driver (e.g. SubG vs. 2.4G) SHALL be specified by corresponding Kconfig
  options as is the case for other driver subsystems. And also as with other
  drivers: At most one driver within a build SHALL match the radio peripheral's
  compatible at the same time.

  References are to the IEEE 802.15.4-2020 standard by default.

      The IEEE 802.15.4 default channel page (see phyCurrentPage, section 11.3,
      table 11-2), e.g. 0. Allowable values depend on the channel pages
      supported by the selected driver.

      Note that the channel attribute is PHY independent although it belongs to
      the PHY layer. That's why it is specified here.
    default: 0
  default-channel:
    type: int
    description: |
      The IEEE 802.15.4 default channel (see phyCurrentChannel, section 11.3,
      table 11-2), e.g. 26. Allowable values depend on the channel page
      supported by the selected driver.

      For the deprecated legacy channel page zero (which is what most Zephyr
      drivers currently support), channels 0-10 are in the Sub-GHz band and
      channels 11-26 are in the 2.4 GHz band.

      Note that the channel attribute is PHY independent although it belongs to
      the PHY layer. That's why it is specified here.
    default: 11
  default-tx-pwr: # Should probably be moved to the radio peripheral level as it has nothing to do with IEEE 802.15.4.
    type: int # if negative values are not yet supported, this should be fixed
    description: |
      The default TX power in dB, e.g. -5, 0 or 3. Allowable values are driver
      specific.

      Note that TX power is not specified in the standard but is an attribute
      commonly used by Zephyr drivers That's why it is specified here.
    default: 0
