        STM32 Clock multiplexer
        Describes a clock multiplexer, such as per_ck on STM32H7 or
        CLK48 on STM32L5.
        The only property of this node is to select a clock input.
        For instance:
                &perck {
                        clocks = <&rcc STM32_SRC_HSI_KER CKPER_SEL(0)>;
                        status = "okay";
                };

compatible: "st,stm32-clock-mux"

properties:
    status:
        type: string
        required: false
        description: indicates the operational status of a device
        enum:
           - "ok" # Deprecated form
           - "okay"
           - "disabled"
           - "reserved"
           - "fail"
           - "fail-sss"
