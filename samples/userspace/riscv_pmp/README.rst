## Userspace with RISC-V PMP

This is an experimental port of Zephyr's userspace features on a RISC-V architecture. It has only been tested on the SiFive HiFive Rev B. The sample demonstrates context switching between threads in userspace, backed by RISC-V PMP hardware, and execution of privileged system calls from user mode.
