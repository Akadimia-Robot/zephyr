properties:
    int-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        The INT signal defaults to active low open drain, so requires a
        pull-up on the board or in the flags cell of this entry.
    fifo-a-full:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 0
      description: |
        Set the trigger for the FIFO_A_FULL interrupt (e.g. if set to 2,
        then the flag is set when the 30th word is written to the FIFO).
        Range: 0-31, Default: 0, same as after Power Reset
    fifo-rollover-en:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Controls the behavior of the FIFO when the FIFO becomes completely
        filled with data. If set, the FIFO address rolls over to zero and the
        FIFO continues to fill with new data. If not set, then the FIFO is
        not updated until FIFO_DATA is read or the WRITE/READ pointer
        positions are changed.
    fifo-a-full-type:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        If false, then the A_FULL status bit is asserted on each sample for
        which the condition persists. If true, then the bit is asserted only
        once until the next A_FULL condition.
    fifo-stat-clr:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        If true, then A_FULL and TEMP_RDY bit are cleared by a FIFO_DATA register read.
    gpio0-mode:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 2
      enum:
       - 0
       - 1
       - 2
       - 3
      description: |
        The mode for GPIO0.
        0 = High impedance input
        1 = Output (open-drain)
        2 = Input with 1MOhm pulldown
        3 = Interrupt output (active low)
        Default: 2, same as after Power Reset
    gpio1-mode:
      type: int
      required: false
      default: 2
      enum:
       - 0
       - 1
       - 2
       - 3
      description: |
        The mode for GPIO1.
        0 = High impedance input
        1 = Output (open-drain)
        2 = Input with 1MOhm pulldown
        3 = Convert Temperature input (active low)
        Default: 2, same as after Power Reset
