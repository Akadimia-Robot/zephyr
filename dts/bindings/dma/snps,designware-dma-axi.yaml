# #dma-cells : Must be <2>.
# The 1st cell specifies the DMAC channel to be used for the data transfer.
# The 2nd cell specifies the hardware handshkaing signal ID
# Example of devicetree dma channel configuration:
#
# &spi0 {
#      /* Configure DMA */
#   dmas = <&dma0 1 18>, <&dma0 2 19>;
#   dma-names = "tx", "rx";
# };
#
# In above spi node 1 and 2 represents the different channels used to
# transfer data between spi peripheral and memory.
# The numbers 18 and 19 represents the peripheral handshaking interface
# The rx and tx channel are exclusive to each other, same channel can be
# used for rx and tx data transfer if the channel is not busy
dma-cells:
  - channel
  - slot
