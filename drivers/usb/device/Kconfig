	default n
	help
	Designware USB Device Controller Driver.

config USB_DW_IRQ_PRI

	help
	USB interrupt priority.

config USB_DW_DMA
	bool "Enable Designware USB Controller Buffer DMA mode"
	default y
	help
	Use buffer DMA instead of FIFO mode for I/O to the controller.
	This will reduce CPU overhead, but (at least right now)
	requires a 64 byte per-endpoint buffer be allocated out/into
	which the transferred data must be copied.  The USB framework
	lacks an API for letting the higher levels of the stack manage
	their own buffers.  Right now this feature exists as a
	prototype to allow such a framework to be added in the future,
	and as a workaround for known hardware bugs in FIFO mode on
	some platforms.


config SYS_LOG_USB_DRIVER_LEVEL
	int
	prompt "USB driver log level"
	default 0
	help
	Sets log level for USB driver

	Levels are:

	- 0 OFF, do not write

	- 1 ERROR, only write SYS_LOG_ERR

	- 2 WARNING, write SYS_LOG_WRN in addition to previous level

	- 3 INFO, write SYS_LOG_INF in addition to previous levels

	- 4 DEBUG, write SYS_LOG_DBG in addition to previous levels
