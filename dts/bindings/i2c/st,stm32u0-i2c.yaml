        STM32U0 I2C Controller
        This compatibility applies to all I2C hardware blocks corresponding
        to the version available in STM32U0 SoCs.
        This version of the STM32 I2C hardware block can be identified by the
        absence of the SMBHEN and SMBDEN bits in the I2C_CR1 register.
        For example, but not limited to: STM32U0

compatible: "st,stm32u0-i2c"
