	help
	  Allow reading the BMA530's on-chip temperature sensor. This creates
	  extra bus activity and increases code size.

	depends on BMA530
	help
	  It is recommended to wait at least 3 ms after power on before any
	  communication with the accelerometer. This time should already pass until
	  Zephyr initializes the driver. Enable this wait time in case sensor
	  sensor initialization occurs earlier
