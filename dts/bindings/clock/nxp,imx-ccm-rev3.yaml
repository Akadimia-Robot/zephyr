    description: |
      Number of clock cells a clock consummer must specify.
  clocks-assume-on:
    type: array
    description: |
      This property is used to specify an array of clocks that need to be
      ungated during CCM Rev3's initialization function. Preferably, these
      clocks should be initialized using the assigned-clock* suite.
  assigned-clocks:
    type: array
    description: |
      This property is used to initialize an array of clocks.
  assigned-clock-parents:
    type: array
    description: |
      This property is used to assign parents to the clocks specified through the
      assigned-clocks property. If this property is not specified, clocks will not
      be assigned any parents.
  assigned-clock-rates:
    type: array
    description: |
      This property is used to set the rates of the clocks specified through the
      assigned-clocks property.
  clocks-init-on:
    type: array
    description: |
      This property is used to initialize clocks that are assumed to be already
      configured. The CCM Rev3 will simply update the frequencies and the states
      of the clocks specified through this property. No configuration will be performed.
