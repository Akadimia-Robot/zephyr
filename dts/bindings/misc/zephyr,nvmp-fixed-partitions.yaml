  This binding is used to describe non volatile partitions.

properties:
  "#address-cells":
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of cells required to represent a child node's
      reg property address. This must be large enough to
      represent the start offset of each partition.
  "#size-cells":
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of cells required to represent a child node's
      reg property address. This must be large enough to
      represent the size of each partition in bytes.
child-binding:
  description: |
    Each child node of the fixed-partitions node represents
    an individual partition. These should usually look like
    this:
      partition_nodelabel: partition@START_OFFSET {
              label = "human-readable-name";
              reg = <0xSTART_OFFSET 0xSIZE>;
      };
  properties:
    label:
      type: string
      description: |
        Human readable string describing the partition.
    read-only:
      type: boolean
      description: set this property if the partition is read-only
    block-size:
      type: int
      description: set this property to specify a block-size
    write-block-size:
      type: int
      description: set this property to specify a write-block-size
    reg:
      type: array
      description: |
        This should be in the format <OFFSET SIZE>, where OFFSET
        is the offset of the partition relative to the base
        address of the parent memory, and SIZE is the size of
        the partition in bytes.
