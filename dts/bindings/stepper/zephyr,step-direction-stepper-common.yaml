include: base.yaml

properties:
  step-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The GPIO pins that are used to send step signals to the stepper motor.

  direction-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      The GPIO pins that are used to send direction signals to the stepper motor.
      Pin will be driven high for forward direction and low for reverse direction.
