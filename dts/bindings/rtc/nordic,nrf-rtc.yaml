    # Guard period should be set to the maximal latency that can occur when
    # controlling the counter (e.g. for how long operation may be
    # interrupted). Guard period limits maximal alarm value that can be set
    # to <top value> - <guard period in ticks> from now. Limitation applies
    # to relative and absolute alarms. Longer alarm values will be
    # interpretted as set too late and will expire immediately. If instance
    # is used only from interrupt context value probably can be decreased.
    # However, if used from low priority thread it may need to be increased.

    #If enabled, overflow different than full range (24 bits) is handled
    #through PPI channel which ensures precise timing. If disabled then
    #counter is cleared in the interrupt which results in accumulative
    #error of counter period if top value is different than maximal.
