    OSRAM ams TMD2635 Proximity Sensor

compatible: "ams,tmd2635"

include: [sensor-device.yaml, i2c-device.yaml]

properties:
  timeout:
    type: int
    required: false
  int-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      Identifies pin for the INT signal on the module. Tristate
      interrupt output based on ramp generator flags RAMP_STAT
      bits 4, 5, 6 & 7. Outputs positive active interrupt signal.

  proximity-gain:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Proximity detection gain of the sensor
      Legal values: 1, 2, 4, 8

  proximity-pulse-length:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      IR led pulse length in us
      Legal values: 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32

  proximity-pulse-count:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      count of IR led pulses (min. 1; max. 64)

  proximity-high-threshold:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      high threshold for interrupt.

  proximity-low-threshold:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      low threshold for interrupt.

  proximity-led-drive-strength:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      This field sets the drive strength of the IR VCSEL current.
      Values are approximate; actual current through VCSEL is
      factory trimmed to normalize IR intensity. For lowest part
      to part variation, 7mA is recommended.

  proximity-interrupt-filter:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      This register sets the proximity persistence filter. (min. 0; max. 15)
      0-> every cycle fires an interrupt
      1-> 1 Any value outside proximity thresholds
      2-> 2 consecutive proximity values out of range
      ...
      15-> 15 consecutive proximity values out of range

  enable-wait-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: Enables wait mode

  wait-time-factor:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Value that specifies the wait time in 2.78ms increments.
      value: 0x00 Increment: 1 Wait Time 2.78ms
      value: 0x01 Increment: 2 Wait Time 5.56ms
      value: 0x11 Increment: 18 Wait Time 50.0ms
      value: 0x23 Increment: 36 Wait Time 100ms
      value: 0x3f Increment: 64 Wait Time 178ms
      value: 0xff Increment: 256 Wait Time 712ms

  wait-long:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When PWLONG (PROX Wait Long) is asserted the wait,
      period as set by PWTIME is increased by a factor of 12.

  proximity-sample-duration:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      This register defines the duration of 1 proximity sample,
      which is (PRATE + 1)*88Âµs. default: 0x1F
