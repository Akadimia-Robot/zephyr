LwM2M Client in Zephyr
----------------------

### SenML CBOR

SenML CBOR content format support takes advantage of the Zcbor library's capability of generating
domain specific code. To generate the SenML encoder and decoder the following CDDL file
is used as an input for the generator:

.. include:: codegen/lwm2m_senml_cbor.cddl
   :code: txt

The CDDL description is based on the RFC 8428 - Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML). For further
details please see the chapter 11 - CDDL.

To generate the encoder and decoder:

```console
sh codegen/lwm2m_senml_cbor_generate.sh
```

The above command uses [comby](https://comby.dev) to apply code modifications

The default value of the number of maximum allowed records doesn't really matter as it's replaced
with a Kconfig option.
