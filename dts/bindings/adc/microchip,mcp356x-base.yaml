properties:
    "#io-channel-cells":
      const: 1

    irq-gpios:
      required: true
      type: phandle-array
      description: IRQ pin
        The bIRQ/MDAT pin from the device, which is active low, configurable to
        either driven or high-Z in inactive state.  This has DRDY, POR, CRCCFG,
        and STP interrupts.

    drive-open-drain:
      required: false
      type: boolean
      description: IRQ pin drive mode is open drain.  The default.

    drive-push-pull:
      required: false
      type: boolean
      description: IRQ pin drive mode is push-poll.  Mutually exclusive with drive-open-drain.

    address:
      required: false
      type: int
      default: 1
      description: Device address
        Internal device address.  This is burned into the chip during
        manufacture and allows multiple ADCs to share the same CS line and yet
        be individually addressable.  The default value is 1, which is used in
        the standard part.
        Valid range 0 - 3

    clocks:
      required: false
      type: phandle-array
      description: External MCLK signal

    amclk-div:
      required: false
      type: int
      default: 1
      description: AMCLK prescaler
        This is the divisor from MCLK to AMCLK.  The default is 1.
      enum:
       - 1
       - 2
       - 4
       - 8

    boost:
      required: false
      type: string
      default: "1x"
      description: Bias Current
        The bias current setting, see ยง5.4.3 and Table 5-5.  Higher bias
        current increases bandwidth and allows higher AMCLK values at the cost
        of increased sampling current (see Figure 2-36).
      enum:
       - "0.5x"
       - "0.66x"
       - "1x"
       - "2x"

io-channel-cells:
    - channel
