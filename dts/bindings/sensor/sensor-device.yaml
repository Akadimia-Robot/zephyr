properties:
  friendly-name:
    type: string
    description: |
      Human readable string describing the sensor. It can be used to
      distinguish multiple instances of the same model (e.g., lid accelerometer
      vs. base accelerometer in a laptop) to a host operating system.

      This property is defined in the Generic Sensor Property Usages of the HID
      Usage Tables specification
      (https://usb.org/sites/default/files/hut1_3_0.pdf, section 22.5).

  reporters:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Sensor input reporter specifiers, used by virtual sensors to synthesize
      sensor channels from one or more other sensors. For example, a lid angle
      sensor synthesized from a lid accelerometer and a base accelerometer.

  reporter-names:
    type: string-array
    description: Provided names of sensor input reporter specifiers

reporter-cells:
  - interval
  - sensitivity
